## Keybindings

- [ ] in quick open, have ctrl+s split vertically
- [ ] when in multiple vertical splits, have ctrl+j go to terminal, but when in multiple horizontal splits, have ctrl+j move between them unless itâ€™s the bottom one - in that case, go to terminal
- [ ] ctrl+l go to chat if chat visible & no panes to the right
- [ ] ctrl+h go to file tree if tree visible & no panes to the left
